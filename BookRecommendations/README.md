Recommendation systems are everywhere. Companies are relying on them to get better sales. We, as consumers, are relying on them to navigate us through vast space of possibilities. We are tired on deciding between many options and we just want to describe few things we like and system would pick the perfect match for us.

This project is about trying some recommendation systems approaches to build a book recommendation model.
