## If you can't implement it, you don't understand it

There is a gap in knowledge when it comes to building machine learning models. Often building machine learning models is made up of two steps:

1. The theory: understand the concepts and apply those concepts to derive an algorithm. That's the kind of stuff that you might get from a book or a journal paper or a typical course on machine learning.

2. Putting the theory into code: this is often a translation of mathematical equations programmed into a computer.

Well, the gap is in putting the math into code. And doing math in code is pretty much exactly what the Numpty library is for.

If you’ve taken a deep learning or machine learning course, and you understand the theory, and you can see the code, but you can’t make the connection between how to turn those algorithms into actual running code, these materials are for you.

## The NumPy Stack in Python

The Numpy Stack in Python is a set of technologies that will enable you, the data scientist, to efficiently perform all stages of a data project, including gathering and manipulating data, exploratory data analysis, visualizing data, and finally implementing algorithms and models to make useful inferences from your data.

### Fundamental technologies:
 - [NumPy](https://github.com/katarinagresova/MLprojects/blob/main/DeepLearningPrerequisites/NumPy.ipynb)
 - [Matplotlib](https://github.com/katarinagresova/MLprojects/blob/main/DeepLearningPrerequisites/Matplotlib.ipynb)
 - [Pandas](https://github.com/katarinagresova/MLprojects/blob/main/DeepLearningPrerequisites/Pandas.ipynb)
 - [SciPy](https://github.com/katarinagresova/MLprojects/blob/main/DeepLearningPrerequisites/SciPy.ipynb)

These are a set of libraries that work together in unison to help you do useful data science tasks in Python. It is called *The NumPy Stack* because NumPy forms the core of all these technologies by giving us the NumPy array.

### The NumPy array

The NumPy array is a fundamental data structure that can represent vectors, matrices and multidimensional tensors. These are the raw materials that data scientists work with. Using other technologies withinn NumPy stack we can do many thins with there raw materials:
 - using matplotlib, one thing we can do is visualize our data by making useful plots like the scatterplot
 - with SciPy we can do statistics with our data, such as significance testing
 - Pandas is a library that makes reading, writing and manipulating data very easy and very efficient
